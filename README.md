# Data-visualization-project
My data visualization project as an assignment and practice for my Data Visualization Course from Dicoding.

## Notebook
1. Download all the files
2. You can run it locally or using Google Collab. For Google Collab,  you need to upload the dataset and assets folder first.

## Dashboard
1. To run the dashboard, make sure to download all the files and run the notebook first.
2. You need to install the requirements in requirements.txt. You can install them manually or use this command in the terminal (Make sure you open the terminal in the same directory as the .py file.).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. To run the app, run this command in the terminal in the same directory as the .py file
```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
